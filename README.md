# SmartCourse: Guiding Your Academic Journey - Course Recommendation System

## Inroduction

This project focuses on building a Course Recommendation System using the Udemy Dataset. The primary goal is to enhance the educational experience for users by providing personalized course recommendations based on their preferences and historical interactions. The system employs algorithms such as Cosine Similarity and Linear Similarity to generate accurate and diverse recommendations.
